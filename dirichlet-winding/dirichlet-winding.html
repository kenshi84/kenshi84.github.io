        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Jacobson et al. [JKSH13] hypothesized that the local coherency of the generalized winding number
            function could be used to correctly determine consistent facet orientations in polygon meshes. We report
            on an approach to consistently orienting facets in polygon meshes by minimizing the Dirichlet energy of
            generalized winding numbers. While the energy can be concisely formulated and efficiently computed, we
            found that this approach is fundamentally flawed and is unfortunately not applicable for most handmade
            meshes shared on popular mesh repositories such as Google 3D Warehouse.
